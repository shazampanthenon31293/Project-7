    <h2>The Funeral</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;line-height: .85;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lavish state funeral held in the honor of Connor Peters. Mr. Peters was a disingusted public servent. Before he was president he served as speaker of the house because he said "His Country needed him". He was the most beloved Republican President since Ronald Regan. And he never tired to bring a divided country together after a divisive president that proceded him. Everyboard mourned him. </p>
