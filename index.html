    <p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;line-height: .85;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President was walking out of a meeting with Ms.Scott the Speaker of the House and he was talking to one of his aides "John i need the Minority Whip"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"House or Senate, Sir" Asks John Radcliff his Chief of Staff as John fumbles with his phone<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"House" Says The President as he looks at one of the secret service agents<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Chief of Staff turns on his phone and starts to dial the direct number of the house minority whip and waits until the secretary of the Minority whip comes on to the phone "Hello Ms.Johnson i need to speak with Mr. James right away" and then the secretary asked who he was and he told her who he was and the fact that he works for the president of the united states then he could swear that there was a red light right on his forehead<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Umm Agent is their a sniper on the roof" Says the Chief of Staff scared fro his life<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bang the president was shot and bleeeding out right on the pavement right outside of the capitol.

Then after half a minute there was a whole bunch of people who came out to try to help the president of the united states. Then one of the nurses who work for the minority leader said "Ummm He is dead" as the Chief of Staff sat there mortified he murmered "i might have been able to save his life is i noticed that he was about to be shot by a sniped i am sorry Mr. Peters"<Br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the chief of staff turned to the secret service agent "Go get me the The Vice President, President Pro Tempore, The cabinet,DNI and the National Security Council" and then the secret service agent turns to the body and then the chief of staff yells "GO"<Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief turns to another secret service agent and says "Go run and go get the speaker of the house.

    <h2>The Funeral</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;line-height: .85;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lavish state funeral held in the honor of Connor Peters. Mr. Peters was a disingusted public servent. Before he was president he served as speaker of the house because he said "His Country needed him". He was the most beloved Republican President since Ronald Regan. And he never tired to bring a divided country together after a divisive president that proceded him. Everyboard mourned him. He was a rare beloved president from both sides. But then there was a divide about how the country should go after his presidency. There were some like Alexander Scott his VP who wanted to continue the stuff that made his predessor beloved and try to heal the country. Mr.Peters swore that he would serve only one term because he wanted to retire and go live with his wife.<br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the republican party there was a renewed split
    between a few factions in the party that Mr. Peters had been able to unite. One faction was the more moderate members led by the Vice President Alexander Scott who were more about ecomiomic conservatism and did not care for some of the more social conservatism espoused by some of the christian evanglicals. This part of party was more Pro-Choice, Pro-LGBTQ+ and Anti-Prayer which annoyed the Evangalics positions. Now President Scott, Senate Minority Leader Mercado and House Minority Leader Davis fall into this category. The second category was those christian Evangalics which was a majority of the republican base. Even though that they made a majority of the Republican base they were a minority when it came to elected members. They were mostly white. They were anti-aborition, anti-evolution, pro-school prayer. The third was the racist end of the republican party. These were orginizations like the klan. That wing was only interested in complete white supremecy. He convinced theme all to work together for a conservate agenda in which they would all have to give up a little bit to get a little bit.<Br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since that Mr.Scott became president he had to give up his position as President of the Senate (Ex Offico as being Vice President) and Vice President of the United States there was a fight between the democrat and republicans on who to confirm as vice president and the cabinet. He fired everybody in the cabinet because they tried to get the house to impeach Mr.Scott for fake bribery claims. The repulbican base wanted him to nominate Harry Duffy (R-CA) the ranking member on house ways and means sub-committee on health. Duff was a envanglical christian and was very popular with the evanglical community. He was given that sub-commmittee ranking member to please the informal envangilical cacus that existed in the Republican Confrence. He was a very polarizing figure within the republican confrence with the more moderate members absolutley hating him for the evanglical caucus to give him a sub committee ranking membership<Br><Br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Democrats wanted him to appoint a moderate member of the democratic confrence, Chris Jenkins (D-DE) to be his VP and they refused to give him a up or down vote because Mr.Duffy was seen too much as a partisan for the Speaker and the Majority Leader. In a meeting between the Majorite Leader and the Speaker the majority leader said "Nobody will vote for Duffy from the democratic caucus because he is way to far to the right for theme to swallow there pride and vote for him"</p>
